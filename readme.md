# 3D-Printed Flexure Micro Manipulator

This project aims to deliver a low-cost, easy-to-build **XYZ Micro-Manipulator** platform. It's designed for applications such as optical alignment, probing electronic components, and microscopy.
Thanks to its parallel kinematic structure and integrated flexures, it achieves good mechanical stiffness for a 3D-printed device, as well as micrometer precision.
